;; I am commenting this out for a bit to see how I get along without
;; it. Originally I thought that I would like it coming from Neovim
;; using Telescope, but the downside to this package is it covers
;; content in the buffer. For example, when using `consult-line',
;; moving from line to line in the results moves the point in the
;; buffer, however, the posframe is covering the buffer so you loose
;; context.
